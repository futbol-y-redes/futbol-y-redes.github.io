										<h2 class="major">WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>
										<p align="justify"><span class="image left"><img src="images/multicapa.jpg" alt="" /></span>Network Science, also known as Complex Network Theory, is based on the analysis of the structure of  networks to explain the processes occurring in them. This discipline is fostering the knowledge of countless networked systems, having applications that range from predicting trending topics on Twitter, to the spreading of epidemics or even to the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases through the analysis of brain networks. In the Laboratory of Biological Networks of the Center for Biomedical Technology (Madrid, Spain) we go one step further and apply several of the Network Science methodologies to the analysis of football/soccer. "You can't describe the behavior of what a player does on the field by looking only at its individual numbers. It is necessary to include the information of the interaction, not only with its team mates, but also with its rivals". This is the premise on which the Sciences of Complexity are based: it is not possible to analyze a complex system breaking it down into its individual parts: it must be analyzed as a whole. Paradoxically, the idea behind Complexity Sciences is being repeated, day after day, by all soccer players: "It is not me, it is the team."</p>

											<h3 class="major">IDENTIFIABILITY OF A TEAM</h3>
											<p align="justify">Identifying patterns in a team's game, or in that of an opponent, can help maximize collective performance. In collaboration with LaLiga, we have analyzed the passing matrices of all the first division teams to quantify which teams have a more defined pattern. Using the identifiability metrics, we show how it is possible to detect what teams imposed their style in a match, regardless of the result.</p>

											<h3 class="major">THE PASS-GOAL PARADOX</h3>
											<p align="justify">Do more passes lead to more goals? In this analysis, we observe how, despite the fact that the teams that make the most passes tend to finish in the highest positions in the table, there is a fundamental factor in the relationship between passes and goals: The moment of the match we are in. Interestingly, it is at the second halves of matches when fewer passes are made ... but more goals! are scored!</p>

											<p align="justify">In 2009, a Barcelona under the command of Pep Guardiola, managed to win the six competitions in which they participated. Not only that. Guardiola's style of playing was a milestone in the history of football. In this work, we analyze the structure of Guardiola's Bar&ccedil;a passing networks, showing how it was different from the other LaLiga teams. This work was chosen as one of the most relevant of the year 2019 by Scientific Reports journal.</p>

											<h3 class="major">WHY ARE NETWORKS USEFUL IN SOCCER?</h3>
											<p align="justify">Thanks to the Science of Networks it is possible to quantify how important a player is for the entire team, but also the alignment of a specific group of players. We can evaluate (and predict) the effects that a player's substitution would have, or even prepare a match based on the opposing team's passing network. And all of that just by applying mathematics to football...</p>

											<h3 class="major">ENTROPY IN SOCCER</h3>
											<p align="justify">The entropy of a system is related to the amount of disorder the system has, but also to how random its behavior is. Starting from this framework, it is possible to evaluate the spatial disorder of the soccer teams and how their organization varies throughout the match. Interestingly, teams have some properties that fluctuate very randomly, while others seem more predictable... </p>

											<p align="justify">Passing networks do not necessarily connect players. Pitch networks can also be constructed, leading to the study of the spatial properties of passing patterns. This type of networks allows to interpret the game of a team going beyond players. You can find a practical example in the study we carried out about Guardiola's Bar&ccedil;a and its organization.</p>
