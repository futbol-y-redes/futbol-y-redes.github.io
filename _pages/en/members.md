* ### Javier M. Buldú (Principal Investigator)

![javier](/assets/images/buldu.png){: .align-right}
Coordinator of the Laboratory of Biological Networks of the Center for Biomedical Technology, Javier M. Buldú is an Engineer and Doctor in Applied Physics from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. He is an expert in nonlinear dynamics and complex systems, but especially in the application of Network Science to biological, technological and social systems. He has published more than 100 scientific papers in international peer-reviewed journals, organized international conferences and schools, and collaborated with various companies on intelligent data analysis. Javier has completed post-doctoral stays at the Center for Astrobiology and has been a visiting researcher at the University of Oxford. It has also carried out research transfer activities, collaborating with various companies in the application of Network Science to the private sector. During the last years he has specialized in data science applied to soccer, developing new metrics from methodologies of complex systems.<br />

* ### Johann H. Martínez (Assistant Professor)

![johann](/assets/images/martinez.png){: .align-left}
My primary interests lie in the Physics of Complex Systems, in which I explore phenomena of network science, information theory, & nonlinear dynamics along with data science projects in the context of neuroscience, social, & biology, among others.<br />
I was always been impressed by research works showing how natural and man-made systems exhibit behaviors typically attributed to physical systems. Hence, I bet for transdisciplinary research to solve problems, in a given field, by resorting to tools from a prima facie completely different one. An innovative way to find new solutions with a different perspective working in interdisciplinary teams emphasizing applied mathematics, statistical physics, & computer science,  with applications to relevant medical, biological, or social problems.<br />
I'm a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Complex Networks (Oxford Academics), guest editor of Chaos Solitons & Fractals (Elsevier), & Chaos Journal (AIP). I'm part of the steering committee of the Latin American Conference on Complex Networks (LANET),  & ENREDANDO, International school of nonlinear dynamics and networks, Organizer of the Brain Networks Satellites @NetSci.<br />

* ### José G. Espinoza (Data Engineer)

![espinoza](/assets/images/espinoza.png){: .align-right}
Computer Science graduate from Universidad del Zulia (Maracaibo - Venezuela) with experience in global projects, excelling in the development, design and maintenance of microservices oriented systems (RESTful APIs) and in the implementation of API architectures using tools such as ApiGee and Swagger. <br />Focused on technologies such as Java (Spring Boot), PHP, JavaScript and Python, in addition to the use of relational databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB). His experience includes handling Git (Version Control Tool), as well as managing application containers using Docker and Kubernetes on Cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, facilitating the deployment and scalability of applications. He currently works as a Software Developer for a European multinational company. <br />His interest in sports has led him to become certified in areas such as Big Data applied to soccer and sports statistics, always seeking to optimize performance and decision making through technology.<br />
